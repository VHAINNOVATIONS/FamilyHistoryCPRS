Family History in CPRS
======================

Family Hostory in CPRS is an enhancement to CPRS that adds Family Historical Data to CPRS/VistA.

Dependencies
------------
- Delphi
- Microsoft Windows 7 / 10 
- Intersystems Cach√© 
- VistA
    - Family History specific KIDs build

Prerequisites
-------------
- Install Vagrant (see: https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/ )
- Install VirtualBox (see: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads )
- Install Git (see: operating system specific instructions ) 

Installation
------------
This automated installation process will create a VistA system on a Linux-based virtual machine.

- Open your terminal application such as a shell under Linux, Command Prompt under Windows, or Terminal.app on Mac.
- Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/VHAINNOVATIONS/FamilyHistoryCPRS.git
- Use the cd command to go to the root folder of the repository
- Type the following command to build the VistA system:
```
vagrant up
```
To provision in AWS adjust your environment variables or modify the 'aws' section of the Vagrantfile and execute:

To provision with AWS as your provider you will need to adjust line 25 of provision/cache/parameters.isc
to contain the username you are using in AWS:
```
security_settings.manager_user: vagrant
```
~By default the username is set to 'vagrant'

If you change this, you need to understand that everywhere in this document where the username
'vagrant' is used, your new username would be used instead. 

To change the name you will need to run the following where 'ec2-user' is your preferred username:

NOTE: The space before vagrant and ec2-user in the example is not a typo.
```
sed -i -e 's/ vagrant/ ec2-user/' /vagrant/provision/cache/parameters.isc
```

Afterwards, you can build the machine in AWS as follows:
```
vagrant up --provider=aws
```

To connect to roll and scroll VistA to install Family History KIDS build for RAPTOR
