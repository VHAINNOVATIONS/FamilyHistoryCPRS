VHA Innovation Project ID 881
-----------------------------

Family History in CPRS is an enhancement to the VA's Computerized Patient Record System GUI application that adds the ability to enter a patient's family history data.
This effort is part of the VA Center for Innovation (VACI). The purpose of this program is to introduce innovative technologies, methods, and processes into VA through employee innovation. These innovations provide a basis for new developments and ideas with potential to improve healthcare for the nations Veteran’s. VACI intends to take a minimalist approach to innovation efforts in an attempt to focus potential vendors more on providing innovative technologies and procedures as opposed to expensive full-fledged programs that involve a great deal of reporting and documentation.
The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) is the Electronic Health Record (EHR) used within the VA System to store Veteran’s lifetime medical information. Family History (FH) is an important piece of medical information collected in this record, however there is not a standardized tool for providers to collect this information in a way that can be tracked easily over time and edited across disciplines. FH is an important risk factor to consider for many disorders including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and mental illness. An accurate FH can guide specific recommendations for disease management and prevention.
